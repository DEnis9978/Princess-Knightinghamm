# Welcome to the kingdome of the Princess Knightinghamm!

This is a simple game I have developed called Princess Knightinghamm. It's a simple project with the help of Brackey's YouTube channel.

Throughout this project, I had the chance to learn valuable stuff such as:

- Audio management

- Game and level design

- Animating main player and enemies

- Pixel art textures and sprites, layers, tilemaps

- GDScript programming

Platforms: Windows, Linux, Web page
