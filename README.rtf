This is a simple game I have developed called Princess Knightinghamm. It\'92s a simple project with the help of Brackey\'92s YouTube channel.\

It was so fun and engaging. Throughout this tutorial, I got familiar with the game engine itself, which in this case is Godot 4.3. I learned what nodes are, what they do, what does it mean to have parent and child nodes, how to animate platforms, characters and enemies with the combinations of nodes and codes, and also how to code in GDScript (which is a programming language we use to code in Godot game engine)\
